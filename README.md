# Stock-Price-Prediction
Stock Price Prediction using LSTM
This project demonstrates the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict stock prices based on historical data. The model is built using Python and TensorFlow/Keras, with data preprocessing and visualization handled by Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

# Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing is expected to be in CSV format, with columns such as Date, Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume.
Replace Google_Stock_Price_Train.csv with your own stock price dataset.

# Results
The model predicts stock prices based on historical data and visualizes the results in comparison with actual prices.
Achieves reasonable accuracy depending on the complexity of the dataset.
